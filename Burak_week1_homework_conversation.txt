I've tested by using the kebab recipes I found online. 
First I've tested all 3 options. 
Then I've asked a unrelated dish to see the response which was answered as intended
At the end I've asked a dish which is not kebab but a Turkish dish. Chatbot answered little more than it should but I think it passed.

It seems like you're asking for a recipe for Grilled Lamb Kebabs. Here’s a detailed recipe you can follow:

### Grilled Lamb Kebabs Recipe

#### Ingredients:
- **For the Marinade:**
  - 1 ½ pounds (680g) lamb shoulder or leg, cut into 1-inch cubes
  - 2 tablespoons olive oil
  - 4 cloves garlic, minced
  - 2 teaspoons ground cumin
  - 2 teaspoons ground coriander
  - 1 teaspoon smoked paprika (or regular paprika)
  - ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust for heat preference)
  - Juice of 1 lemon
  - Salt and black pepper to taste
  - ¼ cup fresh parsley, finely chopped (for garnish)

- **For Serving:**
  - Pita bread or flatbreads
  - Fresh vegetables (such as tomatoes, onions, and lettuce)
  - Tzatziki sauce or yogurt sauce

#### Instructions:
1. **Marinate the Lamb:**
   - In a large bowl, combine olive oil, minced garlic, cumin, coriander, paprika, cayenne pepper, lemon juice, salt, and black pepper.
   - Add the cubed lamb to the marinade and mix well to coat all the pieces.
   - Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or ideally overnight for maximum flavor.

2. **Prepare the Grill:**
   - Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. If using skewers, soak wooden skewers in water for at least 30 minutes to prevent burning.

3. **Skewer the Lamb:**
   - Remove the lamb from the marinade and thread the pieces onto the skewers, leaving a little space between each piece for even cooking.

4. **Grill the Kebabs:**
   - Place the skewers on the preheated grill. Cook for about 10-12 minutes, turning occasionally until the lamb is cooked to your desired level of doneness (medium-rare is around 145°F / 63°C).
   - For added flavor, you can brush the kebabs with extra olive oil while grilling.

5. **Serve:**
   - Once done, remove the lamb kebabs from the grill and let them rest for a few minutes.
   - Serve the kebabs on a platter, garnished with chopped parsley. Accompany them with pita bread, fresh vegetables, and tzatziki sauce or yogurt sauce.

Cag Kebabi ### Ingredients:- **For the Marinade:**  - 1 kg (2.2 lbs) of lamb shoulder or leg, cut into thin slices (about 0.5 cm thick)  - 4-5 cloves of garlic, minced  - 2 teaspoons of salt  - 1 teaspoon of black pepper  - 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes (adjust for spiciness)  - 1 teaspoon of ground cumin  - 1 teaspoon of dried thyme  - 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil  - Juice of 1 lemon  - Optional: 1 onion, grated- **For Serving:**  - Pita or flatbread  - Fresh vegetables (like tomatoes, onions, cucumbers)  - Yogurt  - Fresh parsley, chopped### Preparation Steps:1. **Marinate the Lamb:**   - In a large bowl, combine minced garlic, salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes, cumin, thyme, olive oil, and lemon juice. If you're using grated onion, add it as well.   - Add the thinly sliced lamb to the marinade, ensuring each piece is well coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or ideally overnight for maximum flavor infusion.2. **Prepare the Cooking Setup:**   - Traditionally, Çığ Kebabı is cooked on a vertical rotisserie. If you don’t have one, you can use a grill or an oven.   - If using a grill, prepare it for direct high heat. If using an oven, preheat it to about 200°C (390°F).   - Soak some wooden skewers in water for at least 30 minutes if you're using them for grilling.3. **Assemble Skewers (if applicable):**   - If using skewers, take the marinated lamb slices and thread them onto the skewers, folding them slightly as you go to ensure they are packed tightly.4. **Cooking the Kebab:**   - If using a vertical rotisserie: Place the skewered lamb on the vertical rotisserie and cook it, rotating regularly, until the meat is browned and cooked through (about 30-40 minutes depending on thickness).   - If using a grill: Place the skewers on the grill, and cook for about 10-12 minutes on each side until the meat is browned and cooked through.   - If using an oven: Place the skewers or lamb slices on a baking tray, and cook for about 15-20 minutes on one side, then flip and cook for another 10-15 minutes until well browned.5. **Serving:**   - Once cooked, remove the lamb from the heat and let it rest for a few minutes.   - Serve the Çığ Kebabı on flatbreads or pita, topped with fresh vegetables and a dollop of yogurt. Sprinkle some chopped parsley for garnish.### Tips for Perfect Çığ Kebabı:- **Meat Quality:** Use good quality lamb for the best flavor and texture.  - **Marination Time:** Don’t rush the marination; the longer, the better for a more tender and flavorful result.- **Cooking Method:** While a rotisserie is ideal, you can achieve great results on a grill or in the oven; just make sure to keep an eye on it to prevent drying out.

Your recipe for Çığ Kebabı looks quite detailed and comprehensive! Here are some constructive suggestions to enhance it further:

1. **Marinade Balance**: Consider adding a bit of yogurt to the marinade. Yogurt helps tenderize the meat, adding moisture and flavor. About 1/2 cup would work nicely.

2. **Garlic**: Instead of just minced garlic, you could roast the garlic first. Roasted garlic has a sweeter, milder flavor that can complement the lamb beautifully.

3. **Additional Spices**: Adding a pinch of ground coriander or a touch of smoked paprika could give the kebab an extra depth of flavor.

4. **Marination Time**: While overnight marination is ideal, it's also good to suggest a minimum time (at least 4 hours) to help those who may not plan ahead.

5. **Cooking Tips**: Suggest checking the internal temperature of the lamb. For medium-rare lamb, it should reach about 60°C (140°F), while medium should be about 70°C (160°F).

6. **Serving Suggestions**: Offer pairing ideas for sides or dips – perhaps a simple tahini sauce or a spicy red pepper dip (Muhammara) could elevate the dish even more.

7. **Presentation**: Consider including a note about how to plate the dish attractively, using colorful vegetables or garnishes for visual appeal.

These enhancements can help elevate the dish while keeping its authentic essence. Enjoy cooking your Çığ Kebabı!
